          <p>
            I am a senior Computer Science major at Clarkson University from
            Pawling, New York.

          <h2>Goals After School</h2>
          <p>
            I am still in the process of working out my plans for after school
            is complete. I am trying to decide between pursuing a master's
            degree in computer science or looking for a full-time position in
            software engineering / programming.

          <h2>What led me here? B.C.E. (Before Clarkson Era)</h2>
          <p>
            Before coming to Clarkson I had some computer experience, but most
            of my knowledge was only surface level. When I arrived at Clarkson I
            was a Chemical Engineering student and during my first semester
            decided to add Computer Science as a minor. I ended up really liking
            the classes that I was taking for my minor and decided that I wanted
            to make it my major. Since then I have been open to learning
            whatever I can about programming and how computers work.

          <p>
            I am one of two Lab Directors of the Clarkson Open Source Institute,
            a Computer Science lab at Clarkson open to all students who are
            interested in computers, computer science, and computing. I am also
            a member of the Underwater Robotics SPEED Team and am currently in
            the process of rewriting a portion of their codebase to work with
            new hardware that will be going into the robot this year. This past
            summer I had an internship as a Software Engineer which required me
            to do some programming at a lower level than I was used to which
            helped me to gain a better understanding of the hardware and
            software tools that I was using.
